### Purpose:

This is a sample app intended to show a way of using DrawView in Jetpack Compose

### How to run:

Choose the ‘jpc’ instead of ‘app’ to run the program

### Notes from the contributer:

* The app doesn’t load images asynchronously. Implementation of asynchronous loading is recommended
* The app expects users to allow access to storage. Handling denial is necessary in real app
* In the ListScreen, saved images are shown in grid. Taps on each item won’t cause anything. Implement onClick functionality if needed
* Coloring and sizing etc hard-coded

Thanks divyanshub024 for creating such a useful library.
